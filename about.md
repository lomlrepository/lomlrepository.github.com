description: linksOML is simple but effective!
---
linksOML was designed a more or less a simple test of my own development abilities in a short time
period. It was developed over a period of about 3 hours on the 9th-10th of March 2019. I wanted to 
see if there was a simple yet effective way to make a service like this with only vanilla JavaScript. 
The website you are currently on is the result of that work.
